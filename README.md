# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, number of rooms, location, and more. The model is built using a dataset from Kaggle's House Price Prediction competition.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house given certain features. We used a linear regression model to solve this problem. The dataset used for training and testing is the [Kaggle House Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Dataset

The dataset consists of various features related to the house such as:

- `OverallQual`: Overall material and finish quality
- `GrLivArea`: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
- `TotRmsAbvGrd`: Total rooms above grade
- `GarageCars`: Size of garage in car capacity
- `GarageArea`: Size of garage in square feet
- `YearBuilt`: Original construction date

For a complete list of features, refer to the Kaggle dataset.
